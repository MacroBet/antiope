Back in 1995,Enya still had her creative spark,her own voice.I agree with the reviewer who said that this is her saddest album;it is melancholy,bittersweet,from the opening title song.""Memory of Trees"" is elegaic&majestic.;""Pax Deorum"" sounds like it is from a Requiem Mass,it is a dark threnody.Unlike the reviewer who said that this has a ""disconcerting"" blend of spirituality&sensuality;,I don't find it disconcerting at all.""Anywhere is"" is a hopeful song,looking to possibilities.""Hope has a place"" is about love,but it is up to the listener to decide if it is romantic,platonic,etc.I've always had a soft spot for this song.""On my way home"" is a triumphant ending about return.This is truly a masterpiece of New Age music,a must for any Enya fan!",
"A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely, quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno, and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you've never heard Enya before, you might want to start with one of her more popularized works, like Watermark, just to play it safe.  But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art.",
"I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts, Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout, but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did. It makes it that much more special to all who own this album.",
"This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!",
"Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album.",
"Enya is one of of the most mysterious singers in music today. I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece. It's gorgeous and an album for the soul..."
"This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music, well written and performed with emotion. It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me. She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic. On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record, with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain. I have every Enya album to date, but this one seems to be particularly special. A must for any music lover!",
"Many times, AND WITH GOOD REASON, the ""new age"" label gets slammed for lacking originality and conviction. Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is, in my opinion, her best to date.There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist, but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers. And if you look at what is being released these days, many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya, but don't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know. I know this sounds ridiculous, but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music. Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music, it works even better when it's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.Many artists/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table, but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line, but rather reflects a balance of the artist's intent with the listener in mind.Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions (even when I disagree) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work. Also, thanks to Amazon.com for providing this forum as I think that it clearly benefits the company, but ultimately it also can be a great place for a potential buyer to find his or her next favorite CD.",
"just recently purchased he  ''Paint The Sky With Stars'' CD and was so impressed that I bought 3 of her previously released CD's and plan to buy all her music.  She is truely talented and her music is very unique with a combination of modern classical and pop with a hint of an Angelic tone. I still recommend you buy this CD. Anybody who has an appreciation for music will certainly enjoy her music.,",
